# Computer-Architecture

## Total 3 Projects

### Project 1 - Interpret RISC-V binary code
The goal is to make a program which interprets RISC-V binary code using C, C++, or Python.<br><br>
It reads a binary file containing RISC-V machine code and prints the assembly representation of the code. <br>
The RISC-V instructions used in this project are limited. <br><br>
Used Language: C

### Project 2 - Simulate a single-cycle CPU
The goal is to make a program which simulates the RISC-V binary instructions. <br><br>
This program is an extended version of Project 1 program. <br>
So it was very easy to implement. <br><br>
Used Language: C

### Project 3 - Implement LRU (Least Recently Used alrogithm) cache
#### 10000 lines project
The goal 1 is to find the best cache configuration for the given applications. <br>
The goal 2 is to implement LRU algorithm for cache. <br>
The base program is ***Spike RISC-V Simulater***, and initially the base code uses Random Algorithm as Replacement Policy <br><br>
Used Language: C++

### Review
Project 1 and 2 were easy because the translation of RISC-V instruction is not that difficult. <br>
Project 3 took some time to read, but implement LRU is not that difficult
